        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my homepage! I am a mathematician with research interests in optimal transport and its applications to metric geometry, mathematical general relativity, and partial differential equations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am a Bernoulli Instructor at EPFL.

        <p>
            Before, I held a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the research group of Professor Robert McCann at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Toronto. In between, I was a Fields Postdoctoral Fellow at the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, supervised by Professor Robert Haslhofer, Professor Vitali Kapovitch, Professor Robert McCann, and Professor Adrian Nachman. I was associated with the Thematic Program on Nonsmooth Riemannian and Lorentzian Geometry.
